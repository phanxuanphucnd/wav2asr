THE CHISWICK PRESS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR REVIVED CASLON S FOUNTS PRINTING FOR MESSRS LONGMAN THE DIARY OF LADY WILLOUGHBY
A LITTLE REDUCED IN UGLINESS THE DESIGN OF THE LETTERS OF THIS MODERN OLD STYLE LEAVES A GOOD DEAL TO BE DESIRED
AND THESE SOMEWHAT WIRY LETTERS ARE SUITABLE FOR THE MACHINE PROCESS WHICH WOULD NOT DO JUSTICE TO LETTERS OF MORE GENEROUS DESIGN
INSTEAD OF ENDING IN THE SHARP AND CLEAR STROKE OF JENSON S LETTERS
WHICH TITLE CAN ONLY BE CLAIMED BY ARTISTIC PRACTICE WHETHER THE ART IN IT BE CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS
THIS IS AWKWARD IF YOU HAVE TO READ BRADSHAW S GUIDE IN A HURRY
THE MODERN LETTERS ARE NARROWED BY A THIRD OR THEREABOUT BUT WHILE THIS GAIN OF SPACE VERY MUCH HAMPERS THE POSSIBILITY OF BEAUTY OF DESIGN
MODERN PRINTERS GENERALLY OVERDO THE WHITES IN THE SPACING A DEFECT PROBABLY FORCED ON THEM BY THE CHARACTERLESS QUALITY OF THE LETTERS
FROM THE TIME WHEN BOOKS FIRST TOOK THEIR PRESENT SHAPE TILL THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY OR INDEED LATER
WHICH SHOULD BE INDICATIONS OF A DELICACY OF MATERIAL AND MANUFACTURE WHICH WOULD OF NECESSITY INCREASE ITS COST
ONE FRUITFUL SOURCE OF BADNESS IN PAPER
SIMPLE AS THIS PROPOSITION IS IT IS NECESSARY TO BE STATED
THE DUE RELATION OF LETTER TO PICTURES AND OTHER ORNAMENT WAS THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE OLD PRINTERS SO THAT
BUT IT WAS ALMOST ALWAYS IN EXCESS OF THE ACCOMMODATION AVAILABLE AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE PLACE WAS FULL TO OVERFLOWING
ON THE FEMALE SIDE MATTERS WERE MUCH WORSE
QUOTE THE APARTMENTS SET APART FOR THEM BEING BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE SIXTY PERSONS NOW CONTAIN ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY END QUOTE
FULL DETAILS OF THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE TO BE FOUND IN MR NEILD S STATE OF PRISONS IN ENGLAND SCOTLAND AND WALES PUBLISHED IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE
ONE THE MALE DEBTORS SIDE CONSISTED OF A YARD FORTY NINE FEET BY THIRTY ONE
OF THESE WARDS THREE WERE APPROPRIATED TO THE CABIN SIDE SO CALLED BECAUSE
A HIGH WALL FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT DIVIDED THE FEMALES COURT YARD FROM THE MEN S
THE WARDS IN THIS PART WERE FIVE IN NUMBER ALL IN DIMENSIONS TWENTY FEET BY FIFTEEN WITH A SIXTH WARD FIFTEEN FEET SQUARE
THE MIDDLE YARD WAS AT FIRST GIVEN UP TO THE LEAST HEINOUS OFFENDERS AFTER EIGHTEEN TWELVE IT CHANGED FUNCTIONS WITH THE CHAPEL YARD
BUT REALLY KEPT FOR THE FEW WHO HAD FUNDS SUFFICIENT TO GAIN THEM ADMISSION TO THESE MORE COMFORTABLE QUARTERS
THE STATE SIDE WAS THE PART STOLEN FROM THE FEMALE FELONS SIDE
THE INMATES WERE PRIVILEGED EITHER BY ANTECEDENTS OR THE FORTUNATE POSSESSION OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PAY THE CHARGES OF THE PLACE
THE LONG NARROW YARD STILL REMAINED AS WE SAW IT IN JACOBITE TIMES
THE GROUND FLOOR CELLS WERE NINE FEET BY SIX
EIGHT THE FEMALE FELONS WERE DEPRIVED OF PART OF THE SPACE WHICH THE ARCHITECT HAD INTENDED FOR THEM
AND WHAT REMAINED WAS DIVIDED INTO A MASTER S AND A COMMON SIDE FOR FEMALE FELONS
THE FELONS SIDE HAS A SIMILAR ACCOMMODATION AND THIS MODE OF INTRODUCING THE BEVERAGE IS ADOPTED BECAUSE NO PUBLICAN AS SUCH
AND IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED
IN THAT PERIOD UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WRITS
THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS ACTUALLY MADE WAS ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FOR THE KINGDOM AND SEVEN THOUSAND TWENTY FOR MIDDLESEX
ALFRED THE GREAT ESTABLISHED THE COURT BARON THE HUNDRED COURT AND THE COUNTY COURT WHICH AMONG OTHER MATTERS ENTERTAINED PLEAS FOR DEBT
COSTS WERE THE GALLONS OF SACK TO THE PENNYWORTH OF DEBT
THOMAS DOBSON ON TWENTY SECOND AUGUST SEVENTEEN NINETY NINE FOR ONE SHILLING WITH COSTS OF EIGHT SHILLINGS TEN PENCE
THESE SURELY I THOUGHT SAYS MR NEILD WERE BAD ENOUGH BUT IT WAS NOT SO END QUOTE
WHILST LUDGATE THE GILTSPUR STREET AND BOROUGH COMPTERS ALSO RECEIVED THEM
ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MORE OR LESS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE RULES AND LIVED OUTSIDE WITHIN A CIRCUMFERENCE OF TWO MILES AND A HALF
THE MARSHAL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RESIDENT EITHER WITHIN THE PRISON OR THE RULES
THE WARDEN OF THE FLEET AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ARE TOO WELL KNOWN TO NEED MORE THAN A PASSING REFERENCE
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DISCLOSURES BOTH BAMBRIDGE AND HUGGIN HIS PREDECESSOR IN THE OFFICE WERE COMMITTED TO NEWGATE
THE COMMITTEE ON JAILS REPORTED THAT QUOTE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSE OF THE WARDEN LOOKED INTO THE COURT
WERE PLACES SET APART FOR SKITTLES FIVES AND TENNIS WHICH STRANGERS FREQUENTED AS ANY OTHER PLACE OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT
MATTERS WERE RATHER BETTER AT THE MARSHALSEA
WAS USED FOR DEBTORS ARRESTED FOR THE LOWEST SUMS WITHIN TWELVE MILES OF THE PALACE OF WHITEHALL
ALSO FOR PRISONERS COMMITTED BY THE ADMIRALTY COURT
THE INMATES WHO EUPHEMISTICALLY STYLED THEMSELVES COLLEGIANS
AND FINES IMPOSED FOR CONDUCT DISAPPROVED OF BY THE COLLEGE
THE LORD STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE STEWARD AND OFFICERS OF THE MARSHALSEA COURT AND OTHERS
LEGACIES HAD ALSO BEEN LEFT TO FREE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DEBTORS NOTABLY THAT OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS PER ANNUM
HIS BEQUEST WHICH WAS CHARGED UPON HIS MANOR AT GORING OXON AND HENCE CALLED THE OXFORD CHARITY
HE DID NOTHING BEYOND VISITING THE PRISON OCCASIONALLY AND LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION TO THE DEPUTY MARSHAL
ON THE OPENING OF WHITECROSS PRISON FOR DEBTORS IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN
AT ONE TIME THE LUDGATE DEBTORS ACCOMPANIED BY THE KEEPER
WHILE THE FUNDS OF SEVERAL BEQUESTS AND CHARITIES WERE APPLIED IN ADDING TO THE MATERIAL COMFORT OF THE PRISONERS
AND WAS SO UNFIT TO SLEEP ON THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS SO THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN ASSOCIATED TOGETHER INDISCRIMINATELY
THE LATTER RAISED EIGHTEEN PENCE AMONG THEM TO PAY FOR A TRUSS OF STRAW FOR THE POOR WOMAN TO LIE ON
THE MASTER S SIDE THE CABIN SIDE AND THE COMMON SIDE PAYMENT OF A FEE OF THREE SHILLINGS GAINED THE DEBTOR ADMISSION TO THE TWO FIRST NAMED
AND GAVE THE GARNISH FOR THE COMMON SIDE AT THAT SUM WHICH IS FIVE SHILLINGS MORE THAN MR NEILD SAYS WAS EXTORTED ON THE COMMON SIDE
AND THUS WHEN THE DEBTOR S DEBT HAD BEEN ACTUALLY PAID OR WHEN HE HAD ABANDONED HIS PROPERTY TO THE CREDITORS AND ALMOST DESTITUTE
OR THE KEEPER MADE THEM A SPECIAL GRANT OF SIX PENCE PER DIEM OUT OF THE COMMON STOCK
SOMETIMES RUGS WERE URGENTLY REQUIRED AND NOT FORTHCOMING
A SEVERE WINTER SET IN THE NEW STOCK HAD NOT BEEN SUPPLIED BY THE CONTRACTORS AND THE POOR DEBTORS PERISHED OF COLD
THE SQUALOR AND UNCLEANNESS OF THE DEBTORS SIDE WAS INTENSIFIED BY CONSTANT OVERCROWDING
PRISONERS WERE COMMITTED TO IT QUITE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CAPACITY
AND DEBTORS MIGHT PRACTICALLY HAVE AS MUCH AS THEY LIKED IF THEY COULD ONLY PAY FOR IT
FOR THIS AND OTHER ACTS OF MISCONDUCT THERE WAS THE DISCIPLINE OF THE REFRACTORY WARD OR STRONG ROOM ON THE DEBTORS SIDE
BAD CASES WERE REMOVED TO A CELL ON THE FELONS SIDE AND HERE THEY WERE LOCKED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR THREE DAYS AT A TIME
ALL THE ALLOWANCES OF FOOD PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS HE HAD THE CONTROL OF THE POOR BOX FOR CHANCE CHARITIES
HE COLLECTED THE GARNISH MONEY AND DISTRIBUTED THE WEEKLY GRANT FROM THE PRISON CHARITABLE FUND
THE AUDITORS WERE PAID A SHILLING EACH FOR THEIR SERVICES EACH TIME THE POOR BOX WAS OPENED THE STEWARD WAS ALSO REMUNERATED FOR HIS TROUBLE
THIS GRADUALLY WAS FORCED UPON THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE CORPORATION
AUTHORITY WAS GIVEN TO RAISE MONEY ON THE ORPHANS FUND TO THE EXTENT OF NINETY THOUSAND POUNDS
THERE WAS NO LACK OF AIR AND LIGHT FOR THE NEW JAIL AND SEVERAL EXERCISING YARDS
THE REFORMS WHICH WERE TO BE ATTEMPTED IN THAT PRISON
ONE THOSE AWAITING TRIAL
BUT ALL MINGLED FREELY DURING THE DAY IN THE YARD
BUT WHEN THE WARD WAS OBLIGED TO ACCOMMODATE DOUBLE THE ORDINARY NUMBER AS WAS FREQUENTLY THE CASE
HAVING BEEN COMMITTED TO CLERKENWELL
THEY VIEWED HIM WITH SOME SUSPICION AS ONE OF WHOM THEY KNEW NOTHING
WHEN ANY PRISONER COMMITTED AN OFFENSE AGAINST THE COMMUNITY OR AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL HE WAS TRIED BY A COURT IN THE JAIL
THE CULPRIT WAS THEN COMPELLED TO CARRY THE CHAIR ABOUT WITH HIM
BUT ALL PUNISHMENTS MIGHT READILY BE COMMUTED INTO A FINE TO BE SPENT IN GIN FOR JUDGE AND JURY
WHOSE LANGUAGE AND MANNERS WHOSE FEMALE ASSOCIATES OF THE MOST ABANDONED DESCRIPTION AND THE SCENES CONSEQUENT WITH SUCH LOST WRETCHES
ONE DAY HE WAS TOO ILL TO COME DOWN AND MEET HER
THOUGH THEY COULD NOT FORCE HIM TO GAMBLE HE WAS COMPELLED TO DRINK
AND I WAS OBLIGED AFTERWARDS TO LET HIM HAVE FIVE SHILLINGS TO PAY HIS SHARE
OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF HIS CLOTHES END QUOTE
OR ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF LATERALLY THESE FEES WERE IN REALITY A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE EXPENSES OF THE JAIL
